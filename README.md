# webex-presenter-desk-pro
Uses the Webex Desk Pro feature of PC overlay in a Webex Meetings.  Move your image, change it to a Picture-in-Picture (PIP), change it to a PC PIP and save it is a preset for future use.  
  
*Note: This code uses an API that might require your Desk Pro be in Preview or beta channel for the RoomOS.*

The macro does not require a touch panel be attached to the Desk Pro, but it makes it easier to see the screen when you use the buttons.  
  
***Some of the buttons:***   
  
**Default (Main Cam Only)** - Return to sending main camera only. 
  
**Present Me** - Only presents you full screen in the content channel.  

**Present my PC** - Same as sharing your PC.  

**My Opacity (PC Overlay)** - Changes your opacity when the PC input is the virtual background. 

The macro remembers your last virtual background before selecting the PC as the virtual background.  When the **Default (Main Cam Only)** button is cliked it will return to this background (e.g. custom image, preloaded background, background blur, none).   

The macro determines if your USB-C or HDMI input is available on startup.  If both are connected, it defaults to the USB-C input.  This can be overwritten by selecting the **Defaults** tab and selecting the **USB** or **HDMI** button next to **Default PC Overlay Source**.  This is reset if the Desk Pro is powered on and off.
